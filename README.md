## Problem Statement

Tourists encounter numerous challenges when visiting new places, including unfamiliarity with local services, concerns about overcharging, and difficulty in identifying reliable local businesses. These issues not only hinder the overall tourist experience but also pose risks related to safety, security, and fair pricing. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive application that addresses these concerns, providing accurate information on services, ensuring fair pricing, connecting tourists with trustworthy local businesses, and enhancing safety and security measures.

## Requirements

1. Create a robust directory of local services, including restaurants, transportation, accommodations, and tourist attractions. Include detailed information, reviews, and safety ratings to aid tourists in making informed decisions.

2. Integrate a system that provides real-time travel advisories and alerts, notifying tourists of any potential safety concerns or incidents in the area they are visiting.

3. Implement a rigorous verification process for local businesses to ensure legitimacy and compliance with safety standards. Display a verified badge for businesses that have undergone thorough validation.

4. Provide a tool that allows users to compare prices for goods and services, ensuring transparency and preventing overcharging. Incorporate real-time updates and user-generated data for accuracy.

5. Enable tourists to provide safety ratings and reviews for businesses and services, highlighting aspects related to security, honesty, and fair pricing. This information can guide others in making safer choices.

6. Include an easily accessible section with emergency contact information for local authorities, police, medical services, and embassy contacts. Ensure tourists have quick access to help when needed.
